# 🏭 AI-Based Manufacturing Efficiency Classification

### Using Sensor, Production, and 6G Network Data

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project builds an **AI-powered intelligent monitoring system** for smart manufacturing environments. It classifies real-time machine efficiency into:

* ✅ High Efficiency
* ⚠️ Medium Efficiency
* ❌ Low Efficiency

By leveraging **sensor data, production metrics, and 6G network signals**, the system enables:

* Real-time decision-making
* Early detection of inefficiencies
* Data-driven operational optimization

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Modern smart factories face challenges such as:

* Delayed detection of efficiency degradation
* Complex interpretation of multiple sensor/network signals
* Lack of automated efficiency classification

Without AI:

* Production losses increase
* Downtime goes unnoticed
* Manual monitoring becomes inefficient

## 🚀 Solution Approach

We developed an **end-to-end AI system** that:

1. Collects and processes manufacturing data
2. Performs advanced EDA and validation
3. Trains ML models for efficiency classification
4. Explains predictions using AI explainability
5. Deploys insights via an interactive Streamlit dashboard
